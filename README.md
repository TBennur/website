# Overview
This is the source code behind my website, tanaybennur.com \
This website functions both as a personal website and showcases an image stylizer widget

# Stylizer
The stylizer widget applies prebuilt filters to images \
These filters are found online, and restrict an image to smaller color palettes, creating artistic effects \
Users can upload their own pictures and test the various filters \
The widget utilizes PIL and custom C functions to optimize image conversion
